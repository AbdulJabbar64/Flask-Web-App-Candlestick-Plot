# Flask-Web-App-Candlestick-Plot
Candlestick charts are a technical tool that packs data for multiple time frames into single price bars. This makes them more useful than traditional open-high, low-close bars or simple lines that connect the dots of closing prices. Candlesticks build patterns that predict price direction once completed. Proper color coding adds depth to this colorful technical tool, which dates back to 18th-century Japanese rice traders

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
* Candlestick patterns, which are technical trading tools, have been used for centuries to predict price direction. 
* There are various candlestick patterns used to determine price direction and momentum, including three line strike, two black gapping, three black crows, evening star, and abandoned baby. 
* Many signals emitted by these candlestick patterns might not work reliably in the modern electronic environment.
* Traders supplement candlestick patterns with additional indicators.
* Candlesticks are based on current and past price movements and are not future indicators.

# What is Bokeh?
Bokeh is an interactive visualization library in python. The best feature which bokeh provides is highly interactive graphs and plots that target modern web browsers for presentations. 
Bokeh helps us to make elegant, and concise charts with a wide range of various charts.
Bokeh primarily focuses on converting the data source into JSON format which then uses as input for BokehJS. Some of the best features of Bokeh are:

- **Flexibility:** Bokeh provides simple charts and customs charts too for complex use-cases.
- **Productivity:** Bokeh has an easily compatible nature and can work with Pandas and Jupyter notebooks.
- **Styling:** We have control of our chart and we can easily modify the charts by using custom Javascript.
- **Open source:** Bokeh provide a large number of examples and idea to start with and it is distributed under Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) license.
